Step 1
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Step 2
Mix bread crumbs and dry soup mix together in a bowl.

Step 3
Mix mayonnaise and garlic paste together in a separate bowl. Microwave on high to thin out consistency, 20 to 30 seconds.

Step 4
Brush chicken breasts with the mayonnaise mixture. Cover with the crumb mixture. Place on a baking sheet.

Step 5
Bake on the middle rack of the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
